New site location for Will Lapinel's courses:

<https://wlapinel.course-manager.app>

This site was built using course-manager.app

- This is a web application I'm working on. It's currently in beta phase.
- If you'd like to help me test it out by simply using it for your curriculum
development, I can offer you free lifetime access in exchange. Please let me
know if you're interested!
